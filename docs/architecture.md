# Architecture

## Goals

1. **CLI executable.** Single binary, launched from the terminal. No menubar, no dock icon, no settings window.
2. **Push-to-talk.** Hold Fn, speak, release — transcript appears at the cursor.
3. **Minimal recording feedback.** A small floating pill at the bottom of the screen while recording, so the user knows the mic is hot. Click-through, borderless, hidden when idle.
4. **On-device.** No network calls for transcription. Audio never leaves the machine.
5. **Pluggable models.** Whisper out of the box; Parakeet (or future engines) via a JSON-driven registry.
6. **Native and lean.** One Swift Package executable target. No sidecar processes. No HTTP servers.

## Non-goals

- Cross-platform (macOS only)
- Menubar, dock icon, settings window, preferences UI
- Cloud transcription providers
- AI post-processing, summarization, agents
- Speaker diarization, meeting recording, semantic search
- Auto-launch at login (user wires this themselves with `launchd` if desired)

## Why Swift

- **CoreML / ANE access.** WhisperKit and FluidAudio are Swift-native and run inference on the Apple Neural Engine — lower power, lower latency than CPU/GPU paths in Rust.
- **No FFI for platform APIs.** `AVAudioEngine`, `CGEventTap`, `CGEvent`, `AXIsProcessTrusted`, `NSWindow` — all first-party, no bindings to maintain.
- **Permissions plumbing** (microphone, accessibility) is dramatically smoother in a Swift binary than via Rust crates.
- **AppKit overlay for free.** The recording indicator (see below) is a borderless `NSWindow` — trivial in Swift, awkward in Rust.

The binary is a Swift Package executable — `swift build`, `swift run`, ship a single binary. Even with the overlay window, there is no `.app` bundle, no menubar entry, no dock icon.

## Modules

### `main.swift` (ParrotCLI)

Argument parsing (via `swift-argument-parser`), config loading, module wiring. Calls `NSApplication.shared.setActivationPolicy(.accessory)` so the process has no dock icon and no menu bar entry, then runs `NSApp.run()` to keep the process alive and drive the AppKit run loop (needed for `NSWindow`, `CGEventTap`, and AVFoundation). Exits cleanly on SIGINT. Logs status to stderr so a user running it in a terminal can see what's happening.

Subcommands:
- `parrot` (default) — run the daemon
- `parrot models list` — show registered models, mark which are downloaded
- `parrot models download <id>` — pre-fetch a model
- `parrot doctor` — check microphone and accessibility permissions, print remediation steps

### `HotkeyMonitor`

Global hotkey via `CGEventTap` (requires Accessibility permission). Default: **hold Fn**. Detected via `flagsChanged` events with `NSEvent.ModifierFlags.function` / `kCGEventFlagMaskSecondaryFn`. Emits `.pressed` / `.released`. Configurable via `--hotkey` flag or config file.

**Fn key caveat:** macOS by default maps the Fn (🌐) key to "Show Emoji & Symbols" or "Start Dictation" depending on the user's setting in System Settings → Keyboard → Press 🌐 key to. The CGEventTap sees the keypress regardless, but the system action also fires. `parrot doctor` will detect this setting and instruct the user to change it to "Do Nothing" so Fn becomes a clean modifier.

### `AudioCapture`

`AVAudioEngine` tap on the input node. Streams 16 kHz mono `Float32` buffers into a ring buffer while the hotkey is held. On release, hands the full buffer to the active `Transcriber`.

### `Transcriber` (protocol)

```swift
protocol Transcriber {
    func transcribe(_ audio: [Float]) async throws -> String
    var modelID: String { get }
}
```

Concrete implementations:

- `WhisperKitTranscriber` — wraps the `WhisperKit` package. CoreML, ANE-accelerated.
- `ParakeetTranscriber` — wraps `FluidAudio` (or direct CoreML) for NVIDIA Parakeet TDT.

Adding an engine = one new file conforming to `Transcriber`.

### `TextInjector`

`CGEventCreateKeyboardEvent` + `CGEventKeyboardSetUnicodeString` — pastes the transcript at the current cursor position. Works in nearly every text field on macOS (some Electron apps and secure fields are flaky; platform constraint).

### `RecordingOverlay`

A single borderless `NSWindow` displayed at the bottom-center of the active screen while recording. Provides visual feedback that the mic is hot — the only piece of UI in the app.

Window configuration:
- `styleMask: .borderless`
- `backgroundColor: .clear`, `isOpaque: false`, `hasShadow: true`
- `level: .statusBar` (or `.floating`) — sits above all other windows
- `ignoresMouseEvents = true` — clicks pass through to whatever is underneath
- `collectionBehavior: [.canJoinAllSpaces, .stationary, .ignoresCycle]` — visible across Spaces, doesn't appear in window switcher

Content: a small SwiftUI view hosted via `NSHostingView`, showing a pulsing dot + "listening" text, optionally a live mic level meter fed from `AudioCapture`. Total footprint: ~120pt wide, ~40pt tall, positioned 60pt above the bottom of the screen.

States:
- **Hidden** — idle. No window on screen.
- **Recording** — shown on `.pressed`, mic level animated.
- **Transcribing** — brief spinner state between hotkey release and text injection (usually <500 ms).
- **Hidden** — back to idle after injection.

This is the only reason the process needs an `NSApplication` run loop instead of a bare `CFRunLoop`.

### `ModelRegistry`

JSON-driven, mirrors OpenWhispr's pattern:

```swift
struct TranscriptionModel: Codable {
    let id: String              // "whisper-large-v3-turbo"
    let displayName: String
    let engine: Engine          // .whisperKit | .parakeet
    let sizeMB: Int
    let downloadURL: URL
    let languages: [String]
    let recommended: Bool
}

enum Engine: String, Codable { case whisperKit, parakeet }
```

Backed by a bundled `models.json` resource. Adding a model = appending an entry. Adding an engine = one new `Transcriber` conformance + one entry in the `Engine` enum.

The registry is the single source of truth for: download URLs, file names, sizes, recommended flags, what shows up in `parrot models list`.

### `ModelDownloader`

On first selection (or via `parrot models download <id>`), downloads to `~/Library/Application Support/parrot/models/<engine>/<id>/`. Progress bar to stderr (using `\r` overwrites). Resumable, validates size. Refuses to start the daemon if the selected model isn't present.

### `Config`

Plain `Codable` struct. Loaded from (in order): CLI flags > `~/.config/parrot/config.toml` > defaults.

```toml
model = "whisper-large-v3-turbo"
hotkey = "fn"
inject_mode = "paste"   # or "type-unicode"
overlay = true          # show recording pill at bottom of screen
```

CLI flags override the file. No settings UI; you edit the TOML.

## Permissions

Two prompts on first run, both surfaced via `parrot doctor`:

1. **Microphone** — standard `AVCaptureDevice` request, fires on first audio engine start.
2. **Accessibility** — required for `CGEventTap` (hotkey) and `CGEvent` posting (text injection). User toggles in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility, granting the *terminal* (or whatever launched parrot) permission, since the binary inherits its parent's TCC identity.

`parrot doctor` checks both and prints actionable next steps if either is missing. Without these, the daemon refuses to start.

### TCC quirk worth knowing

When you launch `parrot` from `Terminal.app`, accessibility permission is granted to *Terminal*, not parrot itself. This means:
- Switching terminals (Terminal → iTerm → Ghostty) requires re-granting permission.
- Running under `launchd` requires granting permission to whatever spawns it.

This is a macOS platform behavior, not a parrot bug. `parrot doctor` will identify the parent process and tell the user which app needs the permission.

## Models — what ships

Initial registry:

| Engine | Model | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| WhisperKit | `whisper-small.en` | ~488 MB | Recommended default, English only |
| WhisperKit | `whisper-large-v3-turbo` | ~1.6 GB | Optional larger multilingual model |
| Parakeet | `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3` | ~600 MB | English, fastest on ANE |

Models live in `~/Library/Application Support/parrot/models/`. Not bundled — fetched on first selection or via `parrot models download`.

## Data flow, end-to-end

1. User runs `parrot` in a terminal.
2. `ParrotCLI` validates permissions (`parrot doctor` logic), loads config, instantiates modules.
3. Sets `.accessory` activation policy and enters `NSApp.run()`. Status: `listening`. Overlay hidden.
4. User holds Fn.
5. `HotkeyMonitor` fires `.pressed`. `RecordingOverlay` shows. Status: `recording`.
6. `AudioCapture` starts the AVAudioEngine tap. Buffers fill. Overlay animates mic level.
7. User releases Fn.
8. `HotkeyMonitor` fires `.released`. Overlay switches to spinner. Status: `transcribing`.
9. `AudioCapture` stops, hands buffer to active `Transcriber`.
10. `Transcriber` runs CoreML inference. Returns string.
11. `TextInjector` posts the string at the cursor.
12. Overlay hides. Status: `listening`. Loop.
13. User hits `^C`. Process exits cleanly.

End-to-end latency target: <500 ms after hotkey release for utterances under 10 seconds, on Apple Silicon.

## What we are deliberately NOT building

- No streaming partial transcripts in v1. Press, speak, release, get full text.
- No VAD-based hands-free mode. Push-to-talk is more reliable and uses zero idle CPU.
- No history, transcript log, or clipboard manager. Output goes to the cursor and that's it.
- No custom vocabulary, prompts, or post-processing.
- No menubar, no settings window, no preferences panel. The only UI is the recording overlay. Configuration is flags + TOML.

These are deliberate cuts. Each can be revisited if real usage demands it.

## Project layout (planned)

Organized by feature area. These are folders within a single SPM executable target — Swift sees them as one module, but the directory grouping keeps related code together. If a group later earns its keep as a reusable library (e.g. `Transcription` consumed by another tool), it can be promoted to its own SPM target with no rewriting.

### On Swift "modules"

Swift's module unit is the **SPM target** (one target = one module = one `import` namespace). For parrot v1 we use a single executable target with the folder structure above; everything is in the same module so no `import` statements between files. If we ever want enforced boundaries (e.g. `Transcription` and `UI` shouldn't reach into `Audio` internals), we promote folders to separate targets in `Package.swift` — a structural change, not a semantic one.

## Open questions

- **Parakeet via FluidAudio vs. direct CoreML?** FluidAudio is faster to integrate but adds a dependency. Decide once we benchmark both.
- **Hotkey conflicts.** Right-Option is unused on most keyboards but some users remap it. Print a clear error if `CGEventTap` registration fails.
- **First-run UX.** Bundle `whisper-small.en` so `parrot` works out of the box, or always require an explicit download? Probably the latter — keeps the binary small and the model directory clean.
- **Code signing.** A self-built unsigned binary works fine locally but accessibility permission persistence is more reliable for signed binaries. Decide if we sign for personal distribution.
